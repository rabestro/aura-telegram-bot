# This GitHub Actions workflow defines our Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
# It runs automatically on every pull request to the 'main' branch to ensure
# code quality, security, and correctness before merging.

      # Step 1: Check out the repository code

      # Step 3: Install uv (our package manager)
      - name: Install uv
        run: pip install uv

      # Step 4: Install all project dependencies, including dev tools
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: uv sync --all-extras

      # Step 5: Run security scan for leaked secrets
      # This is a critical check to prevent accidental exposure of credentials.

      # Step 6: Run all code quality checks (linter, type checker)
      # We reuse our `poe` task for consistency with local development.

      # Step 7: Run the unit test suite
